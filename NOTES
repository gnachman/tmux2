Welcome to tmux!

tmux is a "terminal multiplexer", it enables a number of terminals (or windows)
to be accessed and controlled from a single terminal. tmux is intended to be a
simple, modern, BSD-licensed alternative to programs such as GNU screen.

This release runs on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux and OS X and may still
run on Solaris and AIX (although they haven't been tested in a while).

Since the 1.2 release tmux depends on libevent. Download it from:

	http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

To build tmux from a release tarball, do:

	$ ./configure && make
	$ sudo make install

To get and build the latest version control checkout:

	$ git clone git://tmux.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/tmux/tmux
	$ cd tmux
	$ sh autogen.sh
	$ ./configure && make

For more information see https://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=git&group_id=200378
and http://git-scm.com.

For documentation on using tmux, see the tmux.1 manpage. It can be viewed from
the source tree with:

	$ nroff -mdoc tmux.1|less

Some common questions are answered in the FAQ file and a more extensive (but
slightly out of date) guide is available in the OpenBSD FAQ at
http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq7.html#tmux. A rough todo list is in the TODO
file.

A Vim syntax file is available in the examples directory. To install it:

- Drop the file in the syntax directory into runtimepath (such as
  ~/.vim/syntax/tmux.vim).
- Make the filetype recognisable by adding the following to filetype.vim
  (~/.vim/filetype.vim):

	augroup filetypedetect
		au BufNewFile,BufRead .tmux.conf*,tmux.conf* setf tmux
	augroup END

- Switch on syntax highlighting by adding "syntax enable" to .vimrc.

For debugging, running tmux with -v or -vv will generate server and client log
files in the current directory.

tmux mailing lists are available. The visit:
